# calc
Very stoopid calculator writen in c++ (my first working project)

if you, for some reason, want to test it you need first to install cmake,
then go to 'build' directory and type 'cmake --build' in terminal. it will 
generate 'exec' executable file.

this calculator supports only '+','-','*','/','^' and expressions in brackets '()'
type all operands and operators through spaces, otherwice it will crash
